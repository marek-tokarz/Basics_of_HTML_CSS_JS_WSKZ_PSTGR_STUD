    <h1>Trees of Europe</h1>

    <h3>European Beech (Fagus sylvatica)</h3>
    <p>
      The European Beech is a majestic deciduous tree found throughout Europe.
      It can grow up to 40 meters tall and is known for its smooth, silvery-gray
      bark and dense, dome-shaped canopy. The leaves are oval-shaped with wavy
      edges, turning a beautiful golden-brown in autumn. Beech trees can live
      for hundreds of years and are often found in ancient woodlands.

    <h3>Scots Pine (Pinus sylvestris)</h3>

    <p>
      The Scots Pine is a coniferous tree native to northern Europe and Asia. It
      has distinctive reddish-orange bark on its upper trunk and branches. The
      needles grow in pairs and are bluish-green in color. This hardy tree can
      thrive in poor soils and harsh climates, making it a common sight in
      boreal forests and mountainous regions.

    <h3>English Oak (Quercus robur)</h3>
    <p>
      Also known as the pedunculate oak, this iconic tree is widespread across
      Europe. It can live for over 1000 years and grow up to 40 meters tall. The
      English Oak has lobed leaves and produces acorns, which are an important
      food source for wildlife. Its strong, durable wood has been used for
      centuries in construction and shipbuilding.

    <h3>European Ash (Fraxinus excelsior)</h3>
    <p></p>
    The European Ash is a tall, deciduous tree found in most parts of Europe. It
    has compound leaves with 7-13 leaflets and distinctive black buds. The ash
    tree is known for its flexibility and strength, making its wood popular for
    tool handles and sports equipment. Unfortunately, it's currently threatened
    by ash dieback disease in many regions.

    <h3>Silver Birch (Betula pendula)</h3>
    <p>
      The Silver Birch is a graceful tree with distinctive white bark that peels
      in layers. It has triangular leaves with serrated edges and produces long,
      hanging catkins in spring. This pioneer species is often one of the first
      trees to colonize open areas. It's widely distributed across Europe and is
      known for its medicinal properties and use in traditional crafts.
